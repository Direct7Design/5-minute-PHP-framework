# 5-minute PHP framework

Small and fast PHP framework usable for practically any small PHP project. Contains MySQL and MongoDB support, data crypting and automatic caching with Memcached.

## Features

* Fast (almost no overhead) and small (only 150KB of core files).
* Minimal memory usage with lazy-loading system prevents unneeded files from being loaded.
* MVC-based with simple template system.
* Supports MySQL and MongoDB databases out of the box (both can be used simultaneously).
* Can be easily extended with almost any database support, transparently to the rest of the code.
* Encrypts and decrypts (automatically) data passed to the database (encrypting can be defined for each model separately).
* Automatically caches database results with Memcached.
* Supports AJAX requests.
* Contains example of a simple user's object allowing to login the user.
* Easy to maintain and improve.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.3.
* Optional: [mcrypt](http://php.net/mcrypt) extension is required for encryption.
* Optional: [memcached](http://php.net/memcached) extension is required for caching.
* Optional: [PDO with MySQL driver](http://php.net/pdo) extension is required for MySQL usage.
* Optional: [MongoDB driver](http://php.net/mongo) extension is required for MongoDB usage.

## How to start

1. Download the source files (as [zip](https://github.com/pbudzon/5-minute-PHP-framework/zipball/master) or [tar.gz](https://github.com/pbudzon/5-minute-PHP-framework/tarball/master) or clone this repository).
2. Edit the `public_html/index.php` file to adjust config settings: set `absolute_url` and `relative_url` to proper values (refer to inline documentation for more details on config values).
3. *Optional*: you may also want to set the `cookie_name` value.
4. Point your server to `public_html`.
5. You're good to go!

## How to see the build-in example

1. Follow the steps from *How to start*.
2. Rename appropriate file from `app/models` to `usersModel.php` (for example, if you want to use MongoDB, rename `usersModel_mongodb.php` to `usersModel.php`).
3. Refer to the chosen model file for information how to add a example login data to your database.
4. Add appropriate config settings concerning your database to `index.php`:
 + For MySQL: `mysql_db_host`, `mysql_db_port`, `mysql_db_user`, `mysql_db_pass`.
 + For MongoDB: `mongo_db_socket` or `mongo_db_host` and `mongo_db_port`, optionally also `mongo_db_user`, `mongo_db_pass`.
5. Open the page, example login data is - login: _**test**_,  password: _**test**_. 

## FAQ

* _How to use automatic caching?_

Set the `memcache_host` config value to appropriate memcache host (`memcache_port` is also available if needed). That's all.


* _How to use models data encryption?_

Change `crypt_std_key` value to any key you want (with the same lenght) and set `$_crypted` value in appropriate models to `true`. Also, remember to encrypt all data before inserting it to the database (it will be decrypted automatically). Refer to usersModel_ files for example.


* _What should I do next?_

You may want to refer to the documentation of `appConfig::$_defaults` variable for more information about the config settings.


* _And after that?_
